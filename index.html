	The unique yet major differentiating factor in all the creations of universe is 'Perception'.The way we perceive determines the following course of actions of whether to respond or react.As the Shakespeare's poem,All the world's a stage goes,we come,play our part and depart.What marks the orientation of limelight is the journey over its destination.From the choice of a path to traversing it,the clarity of thought originates from connecting the dots,at times,against all the odds.Every question is often posed with a search for its answer.But on a broader outlook,every answer is definetely a conscious result of a conscientious quest to ardently trace it out.The mind or better,termed the master mind has a potent to analyze,no maatter how intriguing or tiring it may be.This is a process that helps to set the chaos into order.A messy mind makes a person pay more price,in the sense of the valuable time,than a clumsy closet which sometimes disdains even the perfect outfits from being the best fits.Beliefs are another inevitable bridge, essentially bridging the gap between dreams and reality.On the spiritual front,as there are multiple religions,but the ultimate esssence being one,similarly,O n the humanitarian front as well there are multiple judgements, but one ultimate justice.This puts an end to the innate longing caused by the internally arising or externally hitting moral dilemmas.A thrust is generated either towards gain or,lasting pain.Sometimes,being as abstract as it could be to At times,as uncertain as it would be..Life is a reflection of our own perceptions.<br>Not to define,but refine the version every single day.<br>It is to accept the happenings as a whole, with the true and pure soul!<br>
